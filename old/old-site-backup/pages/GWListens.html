<h3>About</h3>

<p>This year, the GW Student Association and the Division of Student Affairs announced <a href="http://gwtoday.gwu.edu/new-peer-support-program-%E2%80%98gw-listens%E2%80%99-sounds-call-volunteers">GW Listens</a>&nbsp;- GW&#39;s first peer support network.&nbsp;GW Listens will allow students to anonymously call and speak to a well-trained peer who is ready to listen and help. This peer support program focuses on active listening, empathy, and problem solving techniques, which can assist a student who is looking to speak to someone who might have experience with something they are going through.&nbsp;The program is currently accepting applications for&nbsp;the inaugural class of Volunteers. If you are interested in building better mental health resources on campus,&nbsp;the application to be a GW Listens Volunteer&nbsp;can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HNzFc-pJs6FyfkDmHm7sqGlZRE23ymdc4OR0Ghd86Gc/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1">here</a>.</p>

<p>These students will operate the newly implemented peer support line, which allows a student who is looking to speak to someone about something they are going through to anonymously call in after hours.&nbsp;The first class of GW Listens Volunteers will be trained in the Spring by Mental Health Services Staff.&nbsp;The&nbsp;call center&nbsp;will be operational starting in the Fall.</p>
