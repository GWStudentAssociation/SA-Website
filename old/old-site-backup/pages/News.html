<h3>GW Listens: October 13th, 2015&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The Student Association successfully advocated for the GW&rsquo;s first-ever Peer Support Program, GW Listens. The program will operate as an after-hours call center staffed by anonymous undergraduate and graduate student volunteers. The phone hotline will allow a student who is looking to speak to a well-trained peer about something they are going through to anonymously call in after hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Advocacy for GW Listens began last year, under former SA President Nick Gumas and EVP Avra Bossov. Co-Directors of Health and Wellness Chris Evans and Cole Ettingoff, along with the insights of Dean Mark Levine and President Andie Dowd, helped bring this idea to fruition.&nbsp;</p>
