<h2>Mission</h2>

<p>The mission of The George Washington University Student Association is to further the interests and promote the welfare of all students at GWU.&nbsp;Our responsibilities are defined in four ways:&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>Advocate:</strong>&nbsp;</em>Whether it&#39;s lobbying for more accessible mental health resources,&nbsp;internship credit, or a fall break,&nbsp;we are first and foremost committed to representing the entire undergraduate and graduate population&#39;s interests.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Allocate: </em></strong>The SA Senate Finance Committee is responsible for distributing $1,200,000 to student organizations on campus.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>Advertise: </strong></em>With every GW student being a member of the Student Association, our network&nbsp;reaches all of GW&#39;s 25,000 students. We&#39;re positioned to&nbsp;support&nbsp;student organizations by advertising and promoting&nbsp;programing and efforts.</p>

<p><em><strong>Assist:&nbsp;</strong></em>We&#39;re students too--students who care about helping you have the best GW experience possible. Check out our resources for Colonials like our Syllabus Bank, follow us for updates on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/GW_Students">Twitter</a>, or&nbsp;email us at gwsa@gwu.edu. Erika and Thomas will also announce office hours this fall.&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
