					This year, the GW Student Association and the Division of Student Affairs announced <a href="https://gwtoday.gwu.edu/new-peer-support-program-%E2%80%98gw-listens%E2%80%99-sounds-call-volunteers">GW Listens</a> - GW's first peer support network. GW Listens will allow students to anonymously call and speak to a well-trained peer who is ready to listen and help. This peer support program focuses on active listening, empathy, and problem solving techniques, which can assist a student who is looking to speak to someone who might have experience with something they are going through. Check back for when the application to become a GW Listens Volunteer reopens.
				</p>
				<p>
					These students will operate the newly implemented peer support line, which allows a student who is looking to speak to someone about something they are going through to anonymously call in after hours. The first class of GW Listens Volunteers will be trained in Spring 2016 by Mental Health Services Staff. The call center will be operational starting in the Fall 2016.
