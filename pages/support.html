				<h3>CARE Network</h3>
				<p>
					The CARE Network works with students who may need support and additional resources to help them be successful during their time at GW. The CARE Network consists of representatives from all aspects of life at GW that can help you or someone you know get connected to people who may be able to help. Remember to care for yourself and your peers, check in with what you need to be successful at GW and seek out the resources the university has to offer. As a community we can care for each other through small acts such as talking with friends about how their week is going, or texting when you’re thinking about them. Sometimes letting someone know you’re there can make a big difference, but also remember you don’t have to take responsibility for others. 
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are concerned about someone, you can submit a <a href="https://students.gwu.edu/care">CARE form</a> online and someone from the university will reach out and check in. This can be done anonymously.
				</p>
				<p>Take care of yourselves and each other!</p>
